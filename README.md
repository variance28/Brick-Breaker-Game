# Brick-Breaker-Game
Brick Breaker is a classic arcade-style game that challenges players to control a paddle and break through a wall of bricks. The objective is to use a bouncing ball to destroy all the bricks on the screen while preventing the ball from falling off the bottom of the play area. As the ball hits the bricks, they disappear, and the player earns points.
